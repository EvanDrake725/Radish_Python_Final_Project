# Radish_Python_Final_Project
Evan Drakes final python project
Summary: The point of the project was to use our skills to make a game. I attempted to make a tile based fetch quest.
Arrow keys to move, press A on characters to talk, and click on text boxes to get rid of them
I used lots of ifs, classes, and pygame. I used a lot more in other versions like saving but that got removed.
Used BeepBox for music
Process
1. I learned how to do row and colum movement, as well as how to have the player interact with tiles. I also learned about the tile based system, like how to make a map and specifically a scrolling map.
2. I got stuck trying to get the player to interact with the tiles. Luckily you helped with that.
3. I'd like to add more stuff to do. Add an interior or a second map or something.
4. I'd ask for help sooner. I asked early on, but didn't fully get what was said and instead of asking for clarification i just hit rocks together.
I strayed pretty far. Originally it was supposed to have combat but due to time that got dropped. Admitedly the combat wasn't the main focus of the doc so I see it as not to much harm.
Sheer determination. I decided I wouldn't move on till I go the collision working, and I worked on it till it worked. Again with your help it did.
